!!!
This project is partially done.
Ended up with calculated the passive tension for the kinematic configuration.


To fullfill the need for neural driving musculoskeletal configuration.
We need more information from the neuronlogical side, so I suspended this project in the summer.

The latest updates is the work till July 6, inlcuding the group meeting slides.


The neural project is updated in another repository.
